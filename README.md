# fractals
Code written in IB HL Computer Science and IB HL Math for generating fractals (initially Mandelbrot).

I started working on this code for fun in IB CS, then decided to research fractals for my IB Math IA. A couple days later, I decided to switch my topic to the lambda calculus (Î»-calculus), so I migrated the code here.

You can find previous development history on my repositories [ibhlcs](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/ibhlcs/commits/master) in `programs/py/` and [ia_math](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/ia_math/commits/master) under `code/`.

## Usage
```sh
python3 mandelbrot.py -o /path/to/output_file.png
```
