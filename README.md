# fractals
Code written in IB HL Computer Science and IB HL Math for generating fractals (initially Mandelbrot).

I started working on this code for fun in IB CS, then decided to research fractals for my IB Math IA. A couple days later, I decided to switch my topic to the Î» calculus, so I migrated the code here.
